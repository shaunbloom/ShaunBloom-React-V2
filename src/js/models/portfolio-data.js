		"description": "This is my personal site that I rebuilt about 5yrs ago while trying to get a better grasp on Jquery, HTML and CSS3. It's basically a single page app, so no page reloads of any kind. The site is built to run with or without javascript turned on, and works in all browsers back to IE7. I wanted the site to look and function exactly the same across all browsers. Next steps.... make it completely mobile friendly."

		"description": "After completing a coding challenge in Angular, I decided I would try to recreate my personal website in Angular and make it look, feel and act the same as the original Jquery version. All animation and effects are done using Angular, CSS and HTML only. Jquery made it so easy to do all of the flashy animations on the site so rebuilding it in Angular was definitely a good challenge and fun! Take a look......."

		"description": "At my last job we dove into ReactJS to rebuild our sites. I thoroughly enjoyed wokimg with ReactJS so I decided that it was time to rebuild my web site using Facebook's pride and joy. Rebuilding this site in Angular was a far cry easier than doing it in ReactJS, but I always love a good challenge so I took it on. This rebuild took a bit longer than the Angular version, but works just as well and is again, a replica of the Jquery version originaly built 5yrs ago. React rocks........."

		"description": "Built this simple site for a local custom multicade arcade builder. The site is a simple business card extention offering all the information you can't get to fit on a little card. The site is built fully responsive using bootstrap and completely mobile friendly. The idea eventually is to add shopping cart support and allow customers to purchase parts or accessories directly through <a href=\"http://www.redfloorarcade.com\"></a>."

		"description": "This was actually a coding challenge I built for a job interview. The idea was to recreate visually, exactly what they had sent me as well as wire it up to all of the data. The data came in two JSON files, one with 83 users and the other with 10k records of data for all 83 users. I finished the challenge, and for a bonus I jacked the data set up to 40k records to prove the efficiency of my code, added pagination, live charting, a load spinner and responsive design. Did I mention I did it in Angular as my first Angular project? It's true....."
